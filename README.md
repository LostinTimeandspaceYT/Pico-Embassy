# Pico Embassy

This repo serves as a template for using the [Embassy framework](https://embassy.dev/) on RP2040 based boards.

Credit to GitHub user @`fatfingers23` for their work, which this repo takes inspiration from.


## Setup

You can use the getting started article to load these examples found [here](https://baileytownsend.dev/articles/getting-started-with-rust-an-rp2040)

## More examples

Check the the [embassy_rp examples](https://github.com/embassy-rs/embassy/tree/8803128707b8bd9fc9dcea392a62dfd42aa822d2/examples/rp). Should ideally be able to take any of those and run it inside of this template, this is what it is based off of.

## Wi-Fi

If you are interested in a project template with Wi-Fi, I reccomend checking out [this](https://github.com/fatfingers23/raspberry-pico-w-embassy-template/tree/pico_non_w?tab=readme-ov-file) repo.
